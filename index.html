            <p>Mmm..you look confused. Maybe we need to explain things.</p> 

            <p>With the pause caused by Covid-19, we at MNFurs got a chance to take a long look at our winter event known as Werecamp.  The initial idea of “winter scout camp but with furries” was not a bad idea, but did not completely mesh with what local furs wanted from the event.  The original event lead, Cyber, wishes to relaunch that more “scout camp experience for adults” with the name “Werecamp” elsewhere.  We at MNFurs wish him the best of luck, and will take this opportunity to retool and rename the event to line up with the requests of our local furry community.  </p>
              
            <p>We are keeping a winter event.  This gives us a major event in each season of the year and allows our artists, fursuiters and fans an environment where they can be themselves and fully express themselves artistically.  Being able to play in the snow then have hot cocoa by the fire in the lodge is just too awesome. </p>
              
            <p>We like the camping idea.  Getting back to nature, being able to have fun and fursuit in the snow, and just the cozy weekend seclusion we discovered that many furs liked this unique alternative to picnics and hotel events.  Some days you want to see everyone.  But some weekends you want to unplug and get away from it all and just be you. We got you covered!</p>
                
            <p>So here we are!  Rebuilding the event and website from the ground up.  We are including feedback like being able to rent wings of cabins, and what activities could be offered at the event.  Midwinter Frolic is a semi communal, fursuit friendly, 18+  camping event.  So everyone is asked if they are able to help or pitch in.  If you wish to really shape the event with leading specific activities, cooking certain meals, or offering artistic ideas, we really want to hear from you.  Feel free to contact us at (address?)</p>
                
            <p>Stay tuned here for updates and registration info as Covid-19 restrictions lift.</p>
